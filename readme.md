Add a new field type called "ETAC Has Capability".  This field is always invisible, but if your current user has a matching capability that you select, then the whole field group will be visible, otherwise, the whole field group will not be presented to the user.  Next steps - some extra eyes on security would be helpful.
The field can go anywhere in your field group, and since this field is always hidden, it's position is completely up to you.
